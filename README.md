# Getting Started (making a local clone)

1- open the command prompt in your local
2-route to the directory you want to clone the react application
3- <git clone https://github.com/shaunadel01/project.git>
4- <npm install && npm start>
5- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.



## Note

1- I have developed the application in a way that it calculates the filter Categories dynamically. it means taht if data changes or a new product with a new category (size) is being added to it we don't need to change the code.
